#WeatherPy with Python APIs

## Overview of Analysis

### Deliverable 1: To randomly select 2,000 randomized latitudinal and longitudinal points and find the nearest city using the ``citipy`` module. And then make an API call to [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve current weather data for those cities. 

### Deliverable 2: To use aquired data from Deliverable 1 to locate the nearest cities to randomized locational points, filter said cities for temperature preferences, and then locate the nearest accomodation using [Googe Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview). 

### Deliverable 3: To create a travel itinerary of four relatively close cities featured in Deliverable 2, displaying a potential travel route by ``driving``, ``biciclying``, or ``walking`` in a Google Map, as well as each cities weather and hotel information using [Google Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview)
